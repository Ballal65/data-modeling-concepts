# Chapter 1: Cumulative Table Design
Cumulative table design is a critical concept in data modeling, particularly for maintaining historical data and ensuring comprehensive datasets for analysis. This chapter explores the methodology, use cases, and trade-offs of cumulative table design.

## What is a Cumulative Table?
A cumulative table retains historical data by combining daily snapshots. It merges today's data with the accumulated data from previous days, ensuring a complete history of changes for each entity. This design is often used in analytics for tracking user activity, transitions, and historical metrics.

## Key Characteristics:
History Preservation: Ensures no data is lost over time by maintaining a record of past states.
Full Outer Join: Combines today's and yesterday's data, allowing for unmatched rows in either dataset.
Coalescing Values: Resolves conflicts or nulls when data exists in only one of the tables.
Steps for Designing a Cumulative Table
Prepare Today's and Yesterday's Tables:

Ensure both tables have identical schemas.
Today's table contains new records; yesterday's table holds historical data.
- Full Outer Join: Merge both tables to retain all records, whether in one or both datasets.
- Coalesce Values: Resolve missing or updated values, preserving the latest information.
- Filter Irrelevant Data: Remove no longer needed entities, such as deactivated users.
- Generate Metrics: Compute historical metrics, such as days since the last activity or cumulative engagement.
  
## Example Use Cases
- User Activity Tracking: Cumulative tables can track daily, weekly, and monthly active users, enabling analysis of user retention, churn, and resurrection patterns.

- State Transition Analysis: Monitor changes in user states (e.g., active, inactive, churned) by comparing today's and yesterday's data.

## Trade-offs and Challenges
# Strengths:
- Scalable Queries: Directly query the latest data for insights without expensive joins or groupings.
- Historical Analysis: Analyze trends over time with minimal computation.
# Weaknesses:
- Sequential Backfilling: Backfilling data must follow chronological order, slowing batch processing.

## Example query
Data Growth: Tables grow daily, necessitating periodic pruning of irrelevant records.
Complexity in Deleting Data: Handling PII or inactive users requires additional logic.
Best Practices
Regular Pruning: Define a clear retention policy to manage table size (e.g., drop users inactive for over 180 days).
Optimize Queries: Use indexed or partitioned tables to handle large datasets efficiently.
Clear Schema Design: Ensure schemas are intuitive for downstream consumers.
